# Advanced Protein Analysis Tutorial
## Using Pre-trained Models and Classical Machine Learning

This tutorial contains materials for protein analysis using AI models, focusing on both pre-trained models and classical machine learning approaches.

### Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to:
1. Load and utilize pre-trained ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models
2. Generate protein sequence embeddings
3. Implement proper data splitting techniques
4. Apply classical ML models (Random Forests and SVMs) to protein data
